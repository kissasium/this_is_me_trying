DSA Patterns That Matter:
1. Substring problem patterns - Search, match, and compare subparts of strings
 - https://lnkd.in/giASrwds

2. Sliding window patterns - Efficiently solve range-based problems
 - https://lnkd.in/gjatQ5pK

3. Two pointer patterns - Minimize space by using opposite-end scanning
 - https://lnkd.in/gBfWgHYe

4. Backtracking patterns - Explore all possibilities (used in puzzles, paths)
 - https://lnkd.in/g9csxVa4

5. Dynamic Programming patterns - Break problems into subproblems + memorize
 - https://lnkd.in/gbpRU46g

6. Binary search patterns - Use search space logic beyond arrays
 - https://lnkd.in/gKEm_qUK

7. Tree patterns - Binary Trees, BSTs, traversals, depth
 - https://lnkd.in/gKja_D5H

8. Graph patterns - BFS, DFS, shortest path, cycles
 - https://lnkd.in/gKE6w7Jb

9. Monotonic patterns - Solve problems with increasing/decreasing constraints
 - https://lnkd.in/gdYahWVN

10. Bit manipulation patterns - Optimize using binary tricks
 - https://lnkd.in/gmMMST5J

11. String question patterns - Custom operations, encoding, decoding
 - https://lnkd.in/gkNvEi8j

12. DFS and BFS patterns - Used in grids, islands, shortest path problems
 - https://lnkd.in/gPgpsgaQ

13. Fourteen Coding interview patterns - Combo of logic + optimization
 - https://lnkd.in/gMZJVkFf

Consistency is the key!
